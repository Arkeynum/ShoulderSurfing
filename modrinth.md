# FAQ #
**Q:** Why is the player not looking at the position of the crosshair when holding item x?  
**A:** This needs to be configured using the config options `adaptive_crosshair_hold_items` or `adaptive_crosshair_use_items`.

**Q:** Why is the player not render correctly when using shader pack x?  
**A:** This is caused by player transparency effects of Shoulder Surfing Reloaded. Either disable them in the config (`adjust_player_transparency`) and restart your game or report this to the authors of the shader pack.

**Q:** Can you port feature x to version y?  
**A:** No.

**Q:** Can you port this to quilt, liteloader, rift, etc.?  
**A:** No.

**Q:** Can I add this to my modpack?  
**A:** Yes.
