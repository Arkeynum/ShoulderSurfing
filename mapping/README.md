This version of ShoulderSurfing requires additional mappings as the official mojang mappings in the forge project use different class names in 1.16.5 compared to vanilla. Those mappings belong in this directory when trying to build the project. They consist of a jar containting a tiny mapping file (similar to the jar generated by [yarn](https://github.com/FabricMC/yarn)) which maps the obfuscated symbols to mcp names. Due to legal reasons this file cannot be published.
